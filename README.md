## 📝 Notes Before Playing

- **Please play in Fullscreen mode** <img width="228" height="70" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcfb8c7f-2355-4c52-a50e-009451eed0cb" />
- **Do not use the Quit button** — it is designed for the EXE version, not the web version.  
- **Current demo is not updated for phone resolutions**, so the game may be unplayable on mobile devices.
